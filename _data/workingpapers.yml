  - title: Misinterpreted Persuasion
    # conference: (as "Bayesian Persuasion with Confirmation Bias"), poster sessions at the PETCO and PEM.
    abstract: This paper studies a behavioral model of persuasion where the receiver may misinterpret information designed by the sender. Instead of assuming perfect observation, we allow the receiver to confuse one message for another with some probability. This misinterpretation limits the sender’s ability to influence beliefs and disrupts the standard concavification method of Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011). We also study a second departure in non-Bayesian updating: naïveté, where the receiver fails to account for misinterpretation. Misinterpretation weakly harms the sender without affecting the receiver, but naïveté can benefit the sender at the receiver’s expense. In a binary example, we illustrate how misinterpretation reduces the sender’s optimal payoffs, and when naïveté lowers the receiver’s demand for information. We then extend the analysis to confirmation bias, where misinterpretation depends endogenously on beliefs and strategy. Our analysis complements prior work on non-Bayesian inference (de Clippel and Zhang, 2022) and symmetric noise (Tsakas and Tsakas, 2021), by focusing on structured misunderstanding in persuasion.
