  - title: Misinterpreted Persuasion
    # conference: (as "Bayesian Persuasion with Confirmation Bias"), poster sessions at the PETCO and PEM.
    abstract: This paper examines a behavioral model of persuasion in which the receiver misinterprets the sender-designed information policy with probabilities. The perturbation unravels the concavification technique, but we preserve belief approach by attaching misinterpretation probabilities to induced beliefs. We find that misinterpretation reduces the sender's optimal value from persuasion, and total communication surplus, through bounded implementability. The receiver is unaffected by misinterpretation as long as being Bayesian with respect to the effective information environment. In the binary case, we solved for the sender's optimal value from misinterpreted persuasion. We also looked at when the receiver is unaware of misinterpretation and analyzed interplay between misinterpretation and this naïve misspecification. We find that if there is misinterpretation favoring the sender, receiver's naïveté impairs optimal decision-making, benefiting the sender by reducing the receiver's equilibrium demand for information. Finally, we extend the binary case to incorporate confirmation bias, where the direction of misinterpretation is endogenously determined.
