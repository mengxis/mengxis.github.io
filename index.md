## Hello!

I am a 6th Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. I am primarily interested in Information Economics, Behavioral Economics, and Game Theory. My research scrutinizes the impact of limited knowledge or control over the information environment on communication and learning. 

I am on the 2024-2025 job market and available for interviews.
